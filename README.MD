- TransferLearning: implementation + code to run the base model proposed by Gatys et al. to perform style transfer as well as layer reconstruction code
- Pretrain-Fast-Neural: load pre trained weights from github, perform and output style transferred image using extension model. Also have code to style transfer
video and real time
- Fast_Neural_Style_Model: our own complete implementation of the extension model + training code
